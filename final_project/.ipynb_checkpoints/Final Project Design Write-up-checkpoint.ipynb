These contractors are given the information about items in the bid, cost of items which are estimated by TxDOT Engineers, and can also see the other contractors who have requested information about the project. TxDOT uses the sum of estimated price per items as the estimated price per project which is in turn used as a guideline for producing a budget which is allocated to each project. Underestimating a projects cost is bad for TxDOT because they have then have to find/reallocate resources. Contracting companies would also like find this helpful to bettter compete and win bids.\n",
